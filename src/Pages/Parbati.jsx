        Parbati Hansda: From Hostel Dreams to International Caps

        Perhaps no story encapsulates FSSA’s transformative power better than
        that of Parbati Hansda. A Santhali tribe girl from a poor farmer’s
        family, Parbati first learned rugby at a government hostel where sports
        opportunities were scarce. She was 14 when a few seniors introduced her
        to the game. Intrigued and determined, Parbati worked hard despite
        limited guidance. “Nobody thought that a girl like me would be able to
        come so far and shine in rugby,” she recalls.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
        But Parbati had a dream fueled by her parents’ encouragement – they
        urged her to excel so “she could be on a flight someday.” To them,
        flying meant she would achieve something significant.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
        FSSA became the wind beneath her wings. She joined the academy and
        finally got structured training, proper diet, and a supportive
        environment. She thrived — representing Odisha nine times at national
        championships and captaining state youth teams.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
        In 2021, her childhood dream came true when she boarded a plane to
        Uzbekistan as part of India’s U-20 squad. She later played in Nepal in
        2022 for the U-18 international meet, becoming one of the first girls
        from her district to wear the Indian jersey abroad.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
        Her journey hit a crescendo in 2024 when she was selected for the
        Indian Universities team at the World University Rugby Sevens
        Championship in France — a global stage. She stood out by helping India
        clinch a placement and earning the “Best Player of the Tournament”
        award.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
        From a hostel with free meals to residing at FSSA’s campus, Parbati’s
        metamorphosis has been extraordinary. Now 19, she mentors junior girls,
        telling them, “I’ve given so much effort, and now I want to stick
        around.” She dreams of representing India and winning an Asian Games
        medal.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700 font-semibold">
        Her story — of a shy tribal girl who spread her wings — symbolizes
        FSSA’s mission: unlocking the potential in every child and helping them
        soar.
