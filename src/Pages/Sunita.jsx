        From Village to National Camp: Sandhyarani & Sunita’s Big Leap
      </h1>

        If Sandhyarani’s on-field feats were remarkable, equally inspiring is
        what came next. Her consistent performance earned her and teammate
        Sunita Hansdah an invitation to the Indian national training camp — a
        rare honor for girls from their region.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700 font-semibold italic">
        “We’re incredibly proud to announce that Sandhyarani Tudu & Sunita
        Hansdah have been nominated for the Indian National Senior Women’s Rugby
        Team pre-season camp,” FSSA shared jubilantly.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
        The news echoed across the academy’s campus — two village girls now
        knocking on the doors of national representation. But the journey to
        this camp was far from easy.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
        Sunita, who started in athletics, switched to rugby three years ago
        after joining FSSA. Under structured training, she learned tackling
        techniques, game strategy, and built her fitness. Sandhyarani had
        already proven her ability nationally, but this call-up validated all
        her sacrifices.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
        At the camp, they trained alongside players from across India, gaining
        exposure to advanced coaching. They credited FSSA’s holistic training
        for their preparedness.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700 italic">
        “Nobody thought a girl like me could shine in rugby,” one athlete
        shared. Yet Sandhyarani and Sunita impressed selectors with their skill
        and grit.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
        Their rise — from remote Odisha villages to the national camp — is proof
        of how FSSA changes life trajectories, turning once-unknown girls into
        confident athletes.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
        Even local officials and the District Collector praised their
        achievements. The pride in their community is immense.
